### Project Description:

Developed using PySimpleGUI, this application can calculate the average GPA across 5 different classes or semesters, generate random grades that meet the desired GPA or higher, and figure out the GPA required to reach a target GPA from your current GPA. 

Here is an example of calculating the average GPA for 5 classes:
