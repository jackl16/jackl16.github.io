### Project Description:
This project was developed for CPSC 471, which is the Data Base Management Systems course at the University of Calgary. The project was completed in a group of 3. The workload for the project was partitioned into different sections for each team member to develop. I worked on developing the entire front-end. The website is also designed to be mobile-friendly. Below are some screenshots of the website.
