# About Me:
Hello, I am a Software Engineering Student at the University of Calgary. You can find some of the personal projects and projects that I have developed
    in my classes as a student by clicking the projects link below. I discovered my passion for coding when I developed some games using a program named GameMaker during my childhood. My goal for 2024 is to create 2-3 personal projects every month.

This project was developed for the ChainShift Hackathon, and is deployed on the Internet Computer blockchain. This project was carried out in a group of 3 where I specifically developed the frontend, using JavaScript. This project won first place under the Smart Contracts stream.
