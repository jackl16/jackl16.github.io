### Project Description:
This project was developed for SENG 401, which is the Software Architecture course at the University of Calgary. It was done in a large group of 7. The workload for the project was partitioned into different sections for each team member to develop. Personally, I participated in developing the frontend, where I created the profile page and it's functionalities, maintaining user and user functions using the login token, the sidebar, login and register pages, and the drop-down and filter functionalities of the home page.
