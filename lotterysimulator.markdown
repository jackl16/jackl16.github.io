### Project Description:
This project was developed as a personal project. This project involves using Java to simulate the drawing of lottery numbers. My motivation for creating this was partially drawn from my dad's enjoyment in buying lottery tickets and to demonstrate the odds of winning. More can be added onto this program, such as user inputted numbers and a user interface. Future fake currency can also be added to simulate the gains and or losses that may be incurred.

Here is an example of the program:
