### Project Description:
This project was developed for SENG 550, the Scalable Data Analytics course at the University of Calgary. It was done in a group of 2. The goal of this project was to use what we had learned in class with Apache Spark and apply it to a dataset. My partner and I chose a dataset involving the sales of products on Amazon in attempt to find a trend. The report in the github repository describes in more detail the goals and aims of the project.
